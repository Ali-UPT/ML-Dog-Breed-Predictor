# Project Overview

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)! In this project, I built a ML algorithm to process real-world, user-supplied images. By giving an image, the algorithm gives an estimate of whether it is a dog and its breed or it is a human face or neither. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

# Used Datasets

I used the following two datasets for training the models:
•	Download the dog dataset
•	Download the human_dataset

# System requirements and libraries and Instruction

In order to execute the project, you may need Python 3x, Jupyter Notebook, OpenCV and PyTorch. The detailed list of required libraries can be found in the Jupyter Notebook given in this repository. You can run the Jupyter Notebook using python 3x.

# Acknowledgments

I would like to thank Udacity for providing a great platform that made performing this project possible.
